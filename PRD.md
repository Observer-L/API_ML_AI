## Not doing
* provides both free(watermark) and paid features to users
* Weâ€™ve successfully built the very first part in a program that could be used as an API to generate memes automatically.
By hooking up our program to something like Flask, we could display a web page allowing for users to upload their own images, and get back fully complete memes.
